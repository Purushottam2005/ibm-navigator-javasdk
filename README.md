# IBM Content Navigator Java SDK 
This repository is a comprehensive resource for all materials relating to the IBM Content Navigator Java SDK, including all of the sample code for desktop and mobile use including JavaDocs.

For more information please refer to the main documentation site for the SDK [here](https://ibm-ecm.github.io/ibm-navigator-javasdk/site/index.html)

## Sample projects 

### Android sample
The Android sample [here](https://github.com/ibm-ecm/ibm-navigator-mobilesdk-sample-android) demonstrates the features of IBM Content Navigator SDK (Java) when running in an Android application. 

### Command line sample
The command line sample (`sample.projects/command.line.sample`) shows how to do 
basic operations with the SDK both synchronously and asynchronously.   The Readme is [here](https://github.com/ibm-ecm/ibm-navigator-javasdk/tree/master/sample.projects/command.line.sample).

### Watson command line sample
The Watson integration sample (`sample.projects/watson.command.line.sample`) shows how to apply the SDK as a source of data to 
the [Watson Alchemy APIs](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/alchemyapi).  The sample walks through the specified 
directory on your IBM Content Navigator server and looks for text and image files. For every one that it finds, it performs either a sentiment analysis (if text) or an image tagging (if an image), and places the resulting tags in a comment on the document in IBM Content Navigator.  The Readme is [here](https://github.com/ibm-ecm/ibm-navigator-javasdk/tree/master/sample.projects/watson.command.line.sample).
