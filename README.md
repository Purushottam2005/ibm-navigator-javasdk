# ibm-navigator-javasdk
This repository is a comprehensive resource for all materials relating to the IBM Content Navigator Java SDK, including all of the sample code for desktop and mobile use including JavaDocs.

## Main Documentation Site
For more information please refer to the main documentation site for the SDK [here](https://ibm-ecm.github.io/ibm-navigator-javasdk/site/index.html)


## Sample projects 

### Command line sample
The command line sample (`sample.projects/command.line.sample`) shows how to do 
basic operations with the SDK both synchronously and asynchronously.   The Readme is [here](https://github.com/ibm-ecm/ibm-navigator-javasdk/tree/master/sample.projects/command.line.sample).

### Watson command line sample
The Watson integration sample (`sample.projects/watson.command.line.sample`) shows how to apply the SDK as a source of data to 
the [Watson Alchemy APIs](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/alchemyapi).  The sample walks through the specified 
directory on your IBM Content Navigator server and looks for text and image files. For every one that it finds, it performs either a sentiment analysis (if text) or an image tagging (if an image), and places the resulting tags in a comment on the document in IBM Content Navigator.  The Readme is [here](https://github.com/ibm-ecm/ibm-navigator-javasdk/tree/master/sample.projects/watson.command.line.sample).
